If you can please symlink it to
examples/FastLED_NeoMatrix_SmartMatrix_LEDMatrix_GFX_Demos/neomatrix_config.h
as the copy here is likely out of date, although should be working.
I'm not allowed to symlnk them because the arduino library manager does not allow 
it, but do it locally if you can.

You should be able to get it via
git pull --recurse-submodules

If this does not work, just get 
https://github.com/marcmerlin/FastLED_NeoMatrix_SmartMatrix_LEDMatrix_GFX_Demos
and manually pull/copy neomatrix_config.h

This file is externally maintained with all the demos I have there because it 
allows those demos to work on around 10 hardware backends, including this library.

If you find it's way too big and scary, you can use the shorter matrix_config.h
instead, which provides the basic functionality without all the ifdefs, but it's
also missing some common code used by some of the demos, so if you want all the
demos to work, you really want to use neomatrix_config.h

Please look in the file for ESP32_HUB75_MATRIXPANEL_S3_PORTAL_64BY64 and notice
how Sublime_Demos and Table_Mark_Estes69 have neomatrix_config_whichdefine.h
to set which config you want to enable without having to change the full
neomatrix_config.h for each demo

Your display is not an Adafruit S3 Portal? Not a problem, find the defines for
ESP32_HUB75_MATRIXPANEL_S3_PORTAL_64BY64, make a new code block for your display
with ESP32_HUB75_MATRIXPANEL_YOUR_DISPLAY and then set that define in
neomatrix_config_whichdefine.h in each demo that uses that hardware and resolution

Enjoy
